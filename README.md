## Console application for processing graphs

### Initial data
Takes as input the path to the file with the adjacency matrix.

### Algorithms
- depth-first search;
- breadth-first search;
- search for the shortest path between two vertices (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm);
- search for the shortest path between all vertices (Floyd-Warshell algorithm);
- search for the minimum spanning tree (Prim's algorithm);
- solving the traveling salesman problem (ant algorithm);
